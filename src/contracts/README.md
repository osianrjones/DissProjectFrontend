# Creating a system for smart and secure voting using Ethereum smart contracts. 

This project encapsulates the backend of my solution to the project. Specifically, the creation of a local Hardhat Ethereum instance and the smart contracts deployed to the network.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npm install
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/fullDeploy.js --network localhost
```
